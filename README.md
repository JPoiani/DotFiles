# DotFiles
My fun little files

Init an empty repo in ~, then add remote, or run a git clone in the home directory, move contents of the ~/Dotfiles directory up into the home directory.
Create a ~/.vim folder, move the vim-update.sh file in there, run a chmod +x ./vim-update.sh, run it.
Must have git and curl installed to do so.
Or something like that.
